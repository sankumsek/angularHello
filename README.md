# angularHello

This a test project for 10 Bridges. The following project was a simple angularJS skeleton that required the use of:

  1. AngularJS (JS Framework)
  2. Bower (little bit of NPM thrown in there)
  3. Gulp (Stream Runner)
  4. Bootstrap (CSS framework)
  5. Karma (Test Runner
  6. Jasmine (Unit Testing)
  7. Angular Mocks
  
  
Some issues of note:
  
  1. Some bower_components (specifically the ones pertaining to jasmine) had versioning issues. Proceeded to use CDN
     version for those. Bootstrap was also a CDN.
  2. Didn't use angularUI for any components after I realized that besides using angular-bootstrap, there was no real
     purpose for it being used.
  3. Github commit history is a bit strange because I wasn't quite sure how to deliver the finished product till it       was too late.
  4. NPM was used almost exclusively because of Gulp.
